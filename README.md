# G4_SBS
This repository houses the Geant4 simulation (V11.2) project for the Silicon Beta Spectrometer (SBS), an innovative instrument developed in Byun's Nuclear Instrumentation Lab at McMaster University. Our goal with G4_SBS is to provide a robust G4 framework for the design, characterization, and optimization of the SBS, specifically tailored for beta and gamma spectrometry.

## ðŸ”¬ Silicon Beta Spectrometer

The Silicon Beta Spectrometer (SBS)
The SBS is engineered for precise beta detection, effectively discriminating against gamma events. Its core design features include:

Collimation: A disk-loaded collimator ensures focused detection.

Entrance Window: A Mylar entrance window protects the detector stack.

Silicon Detector Stack: The heart of the SBS comprises a series of Micron Semiconductor Ltd (UK) MSD040 silicon detectors: One 500 Î¼m front detector. Three 1500 Î¼m detectors following the front detector.
