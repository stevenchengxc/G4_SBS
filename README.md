# G4_SBS Intro
GEANT4 simulation for the Silicon beta-ray spectrometer (SBS) developed at McMaster University. 

SBS is a novel spectrometer formed with a telescope concept containing four single-area silicon detectors for beta spectrometry and dosimetry in mixed-field environments at CANDU power plants. 
For more information about the SBS, please refer to Cheng, X., Dyer, B., Hanu, A. R., & Byun, S. H. (2025).
